# Redux

User context is one way to manage state.

Redux is an external library used for state management.

To understand redux we need to understand Reducers.

## Reducers

Example:

```
cartReducer
{
    cartItems: [],
    cartCount: 0,
    cartTotal: 0,
    isCartOpen: false,
}
```

We can use actions to alter our reducer items values

```
Action
{
    type: "TOGGLE_CART_IS_OPEN"
}
{
    type: "ADD_ITEM_TO_CART"
    payload: {}
}
```
